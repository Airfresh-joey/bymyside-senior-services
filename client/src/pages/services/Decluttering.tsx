                q: "How much does downsizing assistance cost?",
                a: "Costs vary based on home size, accumulation level, and services needed. We typically work hourly or project-based. After our free consultation, you'll receive a detailed estimate with no hidden fees. Many families find the peace of mind and time savings far outweigh the cost."

                q: "What if my parent doesn't want to let anything go?",
                a: "This is common and completely understandable. We're trained to work with reluctant downsizers using gentle techniques that honor attachment while working toward practical goals. Sometimes it helps to digitize photos of items, or to know that a donation goes to a cause they care about."

                q: "Can you help if there's family disagreement about items?",
                a: "Yes, we often serve as neutral mediators. We facilitate family meetings, help document wishes, and suggest fair distribution methods. Our goal is to preserve family relationships while ensuring the senior's preferences are respected."

                a: "Absolutely. We coordinate with professional estate sale companies and auction houses. We can also arrange private sales for valuable antiques, coordinate consignment, and ensure your loved one gets fair value for their belongings."
